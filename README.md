This is for the Library Management System with Database Integration: Mini Project. In the Library Management System with Database Integration module we start up the system. From there you can pick between 5 options. Each will either take you to a different operation, as labeled in the option, or you can exit out. Once you pick which operation you want to use you will be given the option to pick an action. This Library Management System will allow you to add, search, and view books, authors, users, and genres. There is also the option in the books operation to borrow and return a book. Once you borrow a book the system will change the books availability so that no other user may borrow the book. These borrowed books have their own table which shows which book was borrowed, by which user, and the borrowed and return date.
